            Why Should You Go Natural and Organic?
        </h2>
        <p class="p2">
            Many products with plastic properties, fragrances, synthetics, dioxins, or other added properties have endocrine-disrupting chemicals that can interfere
            with your bodily hormones. Endrocine disruptors can potentially cause adverse health effects such as endometriosis, cancers, and
            potential infertility. According to Elizabeth Aguirre's article, "A study conducted in Albany, New York in 2019 measured 24 EDC’s (nine phthalates,
            six parabens, eight bisphenols, and triclocarban (TCC)) in pads, panty liners, tampons, wipes,
            bactericidal creams and solutions, and deodorant sprays and powders (Gao & Kannan, 2020).
            They found that in more than 90% of the feminine hygiene products that were analyzed, the
            products contained measurable concentrations of the nine phthalates" (8). Additionally, "18% of the women
            with endometriosis had detectable dioxin levels in their serum. BPA has been associated with
            polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is considered the most common endocrine
            abnormality (occurring in 4-8% of reproductive-aged females) (Crain et al., 2008)" (13). These endocrine-disruptors can cause long-term health problems.
            You should try your best to get natural, organic products to avoid exposure to endocrine disruptors.

            For example, there are other healthy, sustainable alternatives made from water hyacinth, bamboo, and
            banana plant fibers. Some companies have already come out with natural, eco-friendly options such as BanaPads, Saathi Pads, SafePad, and many others!
            1.) BanaPads is an organization based in Uganda that makes their pads from banana plant fibers due to their high absorbency. 2.) Saathi Pads is another company that locally sources banana fibers and bamboo fibers from the state of Gujarat in India. They produce chemical-free,
            biodegradable period products. Just like banana fibers, bamboo fibers have a high absorbency quality, four times more than cotton. 3.) SafePad is a company based in South Africa
            that strives to make reusable, sustainable, and hygenic menstruation products like sanitary napkins. Though their sanitary napkins are made of polyester, their fabric has a positively charged layer to it that helps kill off bacteria and fungi.

                PADS are strips of fabric that are placed on the inside of underwear to absorb period blood. As depicted to the right,
                they come in a variety of sizes such as pantyliners, pads for when you have a light flow, for when you have a medium
                flow, and for when you have a heavy flow. You should change your pad every 3-4 hours to avoid bacteria developing or an
                odor.

                TAMPONS are small products that are inserted into the vagina to absorb the blood. They have a string that hangs from their ends, so that
                when you need to change your tampon, you can pull it out. They usually come in various sizes such as light, regular, and super, depending on your flow.
                Ideally, you should change your tampon every 4-8 hours, or even less, if you have a heavier flow. You want to make sure that you are not leaving one in for too long to avoid
                Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS), which is an illness that can cause some serious health risks.

                MENSTRUAL CUPS are reusable, flexible silicone or rubber cups that are inserted into the vagina to collect menstrual fluid, typically lasting up to 12
                hours before needing to be emptied and cleaned. The menstrual cup is an eco-friendly alternative to tampons and pads that can be reused for several years
                with proper care. Ideally, you should wash it with a non-abrasive soap and water.

                MENSTRUAL DISCS are flexible, disc-shaped devices that sit in the vaginal fornix (the widest part of the vaginal canal) to collect menstrual fluid,
                offering up to 12 hours of protection. Unlike menstrual cups which create suction, discs use the natural
                placement behind the pubic bone to stay in place and are available in both disposable and reusable options. To properly clean the disc, wash it like how you would wash a menstrual cup.

                PERIOD UNDERWEAR is absorbent, moisture-wicking underwear with multiple layers of fabric designed to absorb menstrual flow and prevent leaks, capable of holding
                several tampons' worth of fluid depending on the style. They can be worn alone or as backup protection, and can be washed and reused multiple times, making them both convenient and
                environmentally friendly. To clean them after every use, rinse your period underwear first with some cold water and then wash it in a laundry machine on a delicate cycle.
