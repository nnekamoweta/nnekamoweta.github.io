                    EXERCISE...Though you might not wanna do much physical activity due to the pain and discomfort you feel during your period, exercise can really help some women with relieving period pain.
                    Aerobic and cardio exercises like yoga, pilates, strength training, jogging, and even meditation can help reduce muscle tension and cramps. These types
                    of exercises help stimulate blood flow, release endorphins (the body's natural painkillers), and help to reduce inflammation. Word of caution: Don't try to overwork your body to the point of physical exhaustion! Try and take it easy at first.

                    ACUPRESSURE...is the application of pressure to particular points on the body to help increase uterine blood flow and blood flow to the pelvic area, relax
                    uterine muscles, and to help release endorphins.
                    Here are six acupressure points that you can apply pressure to or massage, along with the amount of minutes you should do it for:
                    1.] LV3 - located on the foot between the big toe and the second toe (1 min with your thumb)
                    2.] SP6 - located on the inner side of your calf about four finger-widths above the ankle (1 min with your thumb)
                    3.] LI-4 - located on the back of the hand between the base of the thumb and index finger (2-3 min via moving your thumb in a circle)
                    4.] SP-8 - located below the knee-joint (1 min with your thumb)
                    5.] SP-9 - located on the edge of the bone inside your lower leg, drag your finger alongside it until it falls into a hole (10-20 seconds via pressing gently)
                    6.] CV6 - located below the navel (1 min at 10 min intervals).
                    If you are concerned that you are applying pressure to the wrong area or it hurts to apply pressure, consult with a professional, a chiropractor, or a doctor.

                    HEAT THERAPY...Studies have shown that heating pads can improve abdominal pain as it brings blood flow
                    to the area to relieve tension. Topical heat via heat pads helps to reduce pain signals to the brain. This is not a
                    guarentee pain reliever for all women as people have varying levels of thickness when it comes to abdominal tissue.
                    However, it is good for temporary pain relief. If it is your first time using a heat pad, you should put it
                    on the lowest setting for around 15-20 minutes. Adjust the settings as needed to best suit your comfortability.
