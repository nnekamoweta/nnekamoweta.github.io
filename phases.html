            <div class="slide active-slide" id="slide1">

                <div class="phase-text">
                    Though the first few days of your cycle technically begin when you start menstruating, for the sake of learning,
                    we will begin with the follicular phase! The follicular phase is essentially a "restoration" period for your body
                    where your body "renews" or "resets" in preparation for the next cycle. This phase, which typically
                    occurs after the first day of menstruation (day 0) to the beginning of ovulation (usually day 14), can last anywhere between 8-17 days, depending on the length of your cycle.
                    The average cycle typically lasts around 28 days, but it can range anywhere from 21 to 35 days and that is OK!

                    During this phase, the pituitary gland in the brain produces follicule stimulating hormone (FSH) in response
                    to the GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) that the hypothalamus releases every one to two hours to help dictate the cycle. As follicles form,
                    they produce the sex hormone estrogen, which stimulates cell growth in the lining of the uterus, cervix, and vagina. There is a dominant follicle
                    that pumps out more estrogen than the others, which consequently prevents the release of FSH from the brain and subsequently the other follicles from further developing.
                    Then, the other follicles "die off", leaving the dominant follicle left to reach its peak maturation.

            <div class="slide" id="slide2">
                <span class="highlight2">OVULATION PHASE</span>
                <div class="phase-text">
                    This is when your body is at its peak for reproducing! Hormones like estrogen and progesterone are at their peak! This phase usually begins on/around day 14 of a typical 28-day cycle when there is a surge of LH (luteinizing hormone) that causes the dominant follicle to rupture and release the egg and ovary growing inside of it.
                    Then, a mass of cells called the corpus luteum develop from the ruptured follicle. The corpus luteum does not permanently become apart of your body; Its purpose is to ensure that your uterus is ready for a baby if fertilization occurs.

                    During ovulation, your body prepares itself for reproduction in various ways. For instance, the cervix starts to open up and the increase in estrogen causes the mucus fibers within the cervix to align themselves from the tangled mess they were arranged in prior.
                    This permits the sperm to get through to fertilize the egg. Furthermore, progesterone spikes and essentially takes over the controls/reigns from estrogen and prepares the body for pregnancy through a process called decidualization where the uterine lining thickens.
                    One might experience different sensations during this part of the cycle such as an increased sexual drive or ovarian pain and cramps.

            <div class="slide" id="slide3">
                <span class="highlight3">LUTEAL PHASE</span>
                <div class="phase-text">
                    Around day 15 of a typical 28 day cycle, post-ovulation, if fertilization fails to occur, the reproductive traits that were once at their peak during the ovulation phase start to decline. Estrogen and progesterone levels are circulating during the luteal phase and begin to drop drastically as the corpus luteum falls or essentially, in other words, "deactivates".
                    The cervix begins to close and the mucus fibers tangle back up, making it no longer feasible for a sperm to get through.

                    At the end of the luteal phase, there is not enough hormonal support to keep the endometrium and the decidual cells all intact. The tissue within the endometrium breaks down and the decidual cells "die" or shed from the uterus, which results in local bleeding. The shedding of the endometrium is the start of the menstruation phase!

                <span class="highlight4">MENSTRUAL PHASE</span>
                <div class="phase-text">
                    Post the luteal phase, menstruation occurs, also known as your period! Menstruation is considered the start of the next cycle and usually occurs around day 1 to day 5 of a typical 28 day cycle.
                    Though the bleeding itself may seem worrisome, it is actually very normal! Just think of it as your body renewing itself. The color of your blood can vary depending on where you are
                    at in your cycle. Bright red blood usually indicates a healthy and fresh flow while deep red could mean that the blood is a little older since oxidization causes blood to turn a darker red.

                    Spotting, or light bleeding, can also occur during the days leading up to your period and the days after; Spotting can either have a brownish or reddish color. If your blood has a pinkish color,
                    it might be period blood mixed with cervical mucus. If your blood is black, grey, orange, possibly pink, or any other color that was not mentioned, you might want to contact your doctor to learn more about what that could mean. Every woman's cycle is different
                    from the next. No one cycle is considered to be the "right" one. Learn to befriend your uterus!
